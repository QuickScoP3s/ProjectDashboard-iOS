# About
The purpose of this app it to be able to create and track progress on all your projects.
Add team members and some details to a project (like owner and contact details).
Additionally you can add your tasks to a project and track how much time you've spent on them.

Are you done working on a task or want to reassign it to someone else? No problem, that can all be done from within the app!
